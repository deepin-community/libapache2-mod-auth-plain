libapache2-mod-auth-plain (2.0.52) unstable; urgency=low

  * mod_auth_plain is now structured as an authentication and authorization
    provider; this is for improved compatibility with Apache 2.4, and to
    allow combining this with other providers and controlling their
    ordering.  You will need to add "AuthBasicProvider plain" to your
    configuration files alongside any AuthPlain* directives.
